Sequoia corpus v4.0
-------------------
october 2012

The corpus contains French sentences, from Europarl, Est Republicain newspaper, 
French Wikipedia and European Medicine Agency.

The corpus is freely available under the free licence LGPL-LR 
(Lesser General Public License For Linguistic Resources)

The total number of sentences is around 3200, and each sentence is 
annotated for part-of-speech and phrase-structure, following 
the French Treebank guidelines
( http://www.llf.cnrs.fr/Gens/Abeille/French-Treebank-fr.php ).

The constituency trees were then automatically converted to dependency trees.

Manual corrections were performed on the version 3.1 to obtain versions 3.2 and further 3.3. The corrected errors were spotted by Bruno Guillaume, using the grew tool, on the
automatically converted dependency trees.
( http://wikilligramme.loria.fr/doku.php?id=sequoia )

Versions 4.0 and above contain manual annotations of long-distance dependencies, as described in :
Candito M. and Seddah D., "Effectively long-distance dependencies in French : annotation and parsing evaluation", Proceedings of TLT'11, 2012, Lisbon, Portugal)


Version history
---------------

V4.0  october 2012
     Manual annotation of long distance dependencies.
     In the conll files, columns 7 and 8 give the head and dependency label that take into account non-local phenomena, leading to sometimes non projective trees. Columns 9 and 10 contain the head and dependency label obtained via automatic conversion, and are necessarily projective.

V3.3 july 2012
     Manual corrections of errors that were spotted by Bruno Guillaume using grew :
     http://wikilligramme.loria.fr/doku.php?id=sequoia   
     - 60 corrected errors in the phrase-structure trees
     - 13 errors coming from the automatic conversion to dependencies (still to correct)
     - 45 false errors (no correction to make)

     Addition of the *xml files : phrase structure trees in the XML format of the FTB

V3.2 a few manual corrections

V3.1 addition of the *+fct.mrg_strict files, strictly compliant to the FTB annotation scheme

V3.0 june 2012
     First public release

Content
-------

** Files *+fct.mrg_strict are files with one sentence per line,
   with phrase-structure in bracketed format,
   in which the phrase-structures are strictly compliant to the French Treebank annotation scheme.

** Files *.xml are the XML FrenchTreebank format for the *+fct.mrg_strict files 

** Files *+fct.mrg are the same sentences, still in bracketed format, but with
   phrase-structures compliant to the ftb-uc treebank instanciation :
   - prepositions that dominate a infinitival VP do project a PP
   - any sentence introduced by a complementizer (CS tag) is grouped into a Sint constituent

** Files *conll are obtained through automatic conversion of the *+fct.mrg files to 
   surfacic projective dependency trees, in CoNLL 2006 format
   From version 4.0, columns 7 and 8 give the head and dependency label that take into account manual annotation of LDDs, that override the automatic conversion, leading to sometimes non projective trees. Columns 9 and 10 contain the head and dependency label obtained via automatic conversion, and are necessarily projective. 

Number of sentences for each sub-domain :
----------------------------------------

561 sentences	Europarl	 file= Europar.550+fct.mrg	
529 sentences	EstRepublicain   file= annodis.er+fct.mrg 
996 sentences	French Wikipedia file= frwiki_50.1000+fct.mrg
574 sentences	EMEA (dev)  	 file= emea-fr-dev+fct.mrg
544 sentences	EMEA (test) 	 file= emea-fr-test+fct.mrg
 

Data split (TALN 2012 experiments)
----------------------------------

The "neutral" domain is made of EstRepublicain + Europarl + FrWiki,
and the split into dev and test sets is the following :

head -265 annodis.er+fct.mrg >> sequoia-neutre-dev+fct.mrg
head -280 Europar.550+fct.mrg >> sequoia-neutre-dev+fct.mrg
head -498 frwiki_50.1000+fct.mrg >> sequoia-neutre-dev+fct.mrg

tail -264 annodis.er+fct.mrg >> sequoia-neutre-test+fct.mrg
tail -281 Europar.550+fct.mrg >> sequoia-neutre-test+fct.mrg
tail -498 frwiki_50.1000+fct.mrg >> sequoia-neutre-test+fct.mrg
